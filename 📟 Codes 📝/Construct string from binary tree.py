# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

#The below code defines a function `tree2str` that converts a binary tree to a string representation following a specific format. This function takes a binary tree `t` as input and returns its string representation.
class Solution:
  def tree2str(self, t: Optional[TreeNode]) -> str:
    def dfs(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> str:
        #The above function `tree2str` calls a helper function `dfs` with the root of the binary tree `t`.

    #The `dfs` function recursively traverses the binary tree in preorder (root, left, right) manner and constructs the string representation.
      if not root:
        return ''
      if root.right:
        return str(root.val) + '(' + dfs(root.left) + ')(' + dfs(root.right) + ')'
      if root.left:
        return str(root.val) + '(' + dfs(root.left) + ')'
      return str(root.val)
    return dfs(t)
    #Inside the `dfs` function:
        #- If the current node `root` is `None`, it returns an empty string.
        #- If the current node `root` exists:
        #- If both the left and right child of the current node exist, it constructs a string representing the current node's value followed by its left subtree and right subtree enclosed within parentheses.
        #- If only the left child exists, it constructs a string representing the current node's value followed by its left subtree enclosed within parentheses.
        #- If only the right child exists or if neither child exists, it constructs a string representing the current node's value.

    #Finally, the `tree2str` function returns the result obtained from the `dfs` function, which represents the string representation of the binary tree `t` following the preorder traversal.

    #In summary, the code performs a recursive depth-first traversal of the binary tree and constructs a string representation following a specific format, where each node's value is enclosed within parentheses and separated by '(' and ')'.
