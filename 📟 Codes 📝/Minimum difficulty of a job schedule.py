##The below Python code is designed to find the minimum difficulty to complete a set of jobs within `d` days.
class Solution:

    #`minDifficulty`: The function `minDifficulty` takes two parameters: `jobDifficulty`, a list of integers representing the difficulty of each job, and `d`, an integer representing the number of days available to complete the jobs.
  def minDifficulty(self, jobDifficulty: List[int], d: int) -> int:
    n = len(jobDifficulty)
    if d > n: #It first checks if the number of days `d` is greater than the total number of jobs `n`. If so, it's impossible to complete all jobs within the given number of days.
      return -1 #It returns -1.

    # dp[i][k] := the minimum difficulty to schedule the first i jobs in k days
    dp = [[math.inf] * (d + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
      for k in range(1, d + 1):
        #It initializes a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `(n + 1) x (d + 1)`, where `dp[i][k]` represents the minimum difficulty to schedule the first `i` jobs in `k` days. The initial values are set to infinity (`math.inf`), except for `dp[0][0]` which is set to 0.

        maxDifficulty = 0  # max(job[j + 1..i])
        for j in range(i - 1, k - 2, -1):  # 1-based. It iterates over each job `i` from 1 to `n` and each possible number of days `k` from 1 to `d`. For each combination of `i` and `k`, it calculates the minimum difficulty to schedule the first `i` jobs in `k` days.
          maxDifficulty = max(maxDifficulty, jobDifficulty[j])  # 0-based
          dp[i][k] = min(dp[i][k], dp[j][k - 1] + maxDifficulty) #Within the nested loop, it also iterates over previous jobs `j` starting from `i - 1` and going backward to `k - 2` (since we need at least `k - 1` jobs to have `k` days available). For each `j`, it updates the maximum difficulty encountered so far (`maxDifficulty`) and calculates the minimum difficulty for the current combination of `i` and `k` by taking the minimum of the current value of `dp[i][k]` and `dp[j][k - 1] + maxDifficulty`.

    return dp[n][d] #Finally, it returns `dp[n][d]`, which represents the minimum difficulty to schedule all `n` jobs in `d` days.

    #This dynamic programming approach efficiently computes the minimum difficulty to complete the jobs within the given number of days by considering all possible combinations of jobs and days.
