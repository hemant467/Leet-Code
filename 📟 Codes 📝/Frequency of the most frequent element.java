//The below java function aims to find the maximum frequency of any element in the array `nums` after performing at most `k` operations, where each operation consists of incrementing or decrementing any element in the array by 1.
class Solution 
{
  public int maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k) 
  {
    //Initialization:

    //Initialize two variables:
    int ans = 0; //`ans` to store the maximum frequency found so far
    long sum = 0; //`sum` to keep track of the sum of elements within the sliding window.

    Arrays.sort(nums); //Sort the array `nums` in non-decreasing order to facilitate efficient window sliding.

    //Sliding Window Technique:
    for (int l = 0, r = 0; r < nums.length; ++r) //Iterate over the array `nums` using two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), initially both pointing to the start of the array (`0`).

    //At each iteration, expand the window by moving the right pointer (`r`) to the right.

    {
      sum += nums[r]; //Calculate the sum of elements within the current window by adding `nums[r]` to `sum`.

      while (sum + k < (long) nums[r] * (r - l + 1)) //Check if the sum plus `k` is less than the sum of the elements in the current window if they were all equal to `nums[r]`. This condition (`sum + k < (long) nums[r] * (r - l + 1)`) ensures that the operation of incrementing/decrementing each element in the window to be equal to `nums[r]` is possible within the limit of `k` operations.

        sum -= nums[l++]; //If it's not possible, shrink the window from the left by moving the left pointer (`l`) to the right and subtracting `nums[l]` from `sum`. Repeat this step until the condition is satisfied.

      ans = Math.max(ans, r - l + 1); //Update `ans` with the maximum frequency found so far, which is the length of the current window (`r - l + 1`).
    }

    //Return the Result:
    return ans; //After iterating through all elements, return `ans`, which contains the maximum frequency found after performing at most `k` operations.
  }
    //Time Complexity : O(sort)
    //Space Complexity : O(sort)

    //The above code efficiently uses the sliding window technique to find the maximum frequency of any element in the array after performing at most `k` operations. The sorting of the array allows for a simplified calculation of the window sum.
