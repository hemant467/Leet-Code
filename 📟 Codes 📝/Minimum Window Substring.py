#The below Python code aims to find the minimum window in string `s` that contains all the characters in string `t`.
class Solution:
  def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:

    count = collections.Counter(t) #Initialize a Counter `count` to store the frequency of characters in string `t`.
    required = len(t) #Initialize `required` to the length of string `t`, representing the number of characters needed to be found in the window.
    bestLeft = -1 #Initialize `bestLeft` to -1 and `minLength` to a value larger than the length of string `s`. These variables will track the minimum window found so far.
    minLength = len(s) + 1 

    l = 0 #Initialize the left pointer `l` to 0.
    for r, c in enumerate(s): #iterate over each character `c` in string `s` along with its index `r`.
      count[c] -= 1 #Decrement the count of character `c` in the Counter `count`.
      if count[c] >= 0: #If the count becomes non-negative after decrementing.
        required -= 1 #Decrement `required` as well.
      
      while required == 0: #Enter a while loop to shrink the window until all characters in `t` are found in the current window:
        if r - l + 1 < minLength: #If the length of the current window is smaller than `minLength`.
          bestLeft = l #update `bestLeft` to the current window's indices.
          minLength = r - l + 1 #update `minLength` to the current window's indices.
        count[s[l]] += 1 #Increment the count of the character at index `l` in `s`.
        if count[s[l]] > 0: #If the count becomes positive after incrementing.
          required += 1 #increment `required` as well.
        l += 1 #Move the left pointer `l` to the right to shrink the window.

    #Return:
    return '' if bestLeft == -1 else s[bestLeft: bestLeft + minLength] #After the loop ends, return the minimum window found. If no such window exists (i.e., `bestLeft` is still -1), return an empty string. Otherwise, return the substring of `s` starting from index `bestLeft` with length `minLength`.

    #The above code uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum window in `s` that contains all characters in `t`. It efficiently updates the window boundaries while maintaining the required characters using the Counter data structure.
