#The below code is an implementation of a dynamic programming solution to the problem of decoding a string into alphabetic characters.
class Solution:
    #Initialization:
  def numDecodings(self, s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    # dp[i] := the number of ways to decode s[i..n)
    dp = [0] * n + [1]
    #It initializes a list `dp` of size `n+1`, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. Each element `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to decode the substring `s[i:n]`.

    #Validity Check: It defines a helper function `isValid` to check if a single character or a pair of characters forms a valid encoding. For a single character, it checks if it's not '0'. For a pair of characters, it checks if it forms a valid encoding according to the problem's constraints.
    def isValid(a: str, b=None) -> bool:
      if b:
        #Base Case: It initializes the last element of `dp` to 1 if the last character of the input string is valid (i.e., not '0').
        return a == '1' or a == '2' and b < '7'
      return a != '0'

    #Dynamic Programming Iteration:  It iterates over the string `s` in reverse order (from `n-2` to 0).
    if isValid(s[-1]):
      dp[n - 1] = 1

    #At each index `i`, it considers two cases:
    for i in reversed(range(n - 1)):
      if isValid(s[i]):
        dp[i] += dp[i + 1]
        #If the single character `s[i]` forms a valid encoding, it adds `dp[i+1]` to `dp[i]`. This means that we can decode the substring `s[i:n]` by decoding the substring starting from index `i+1` and appending the decoded character at index `i`.

      if isValid(s[i], s[i + 1]):
        dp[i] += dp[i + 2]
        #If the pair of characters `s[i:i+2]` forms a valid encoding, it adds `dp[i+2]` to `dp[i]`. This means that we can decode the substring `s[i:n]` by decoding the substring starting from index `i+2` and appending the decoded character pair at indices `i` and `i+1`.

    #Result:
    return dp[0] #Finally, it returns `dp[0]`, which represents the number of ways to decode the entire string `s`.

    #The above dynamic programming approach ensures that each substring is decoded only once, and the results are accumulated to find the total number of ways to decode the entire string. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.
