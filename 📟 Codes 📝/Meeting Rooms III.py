#The below code aims to find the most booked room given a list of meetings and the number of rooms available. It employs a greedy strategy to allocate rooms for meetings.
class Solution:
  def mostBooked(self, n: int, meetings: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = [0] * n #Initializing a list `count` of length `n` to keep track of the number of meetings booked for each room.

    meetings.sort() #`meetings` list is sorted based on the start time of each meeting.

    occupied = []  # (endTime, roomId). It initializes an empty list `occupied` to track meetings that are currently happening. Each element in `occupied` is a tuple `(endTime, roomId)` indicating the end time of the meeting and the room ID.
    
    availableRoomIds = [i for i in range(n)]
    
    heapq.heapify(availableRoomIds)

    for start, end in meetings:
      # Push meetings ending before this `meeting` in occupied to the
      # `availableRoomsIds`.
      while occupied and occupied[0][0] <= start:
        heapq.heappush(availableRoomIds, heapq.heappop(occupied)[1]) #It initializes a min-heap `availableRoomIds` containing room IDs representing available rooms. This heap is used to efficiently find the room with the earliest available end time.

        #The code iterates through each meeting in the sorted `meetings` list. For each meeting:

      if availableRoomIds:
        roomId = heapq.heappop(availableRoomIds) #It pops meetings from the `occupied` list that have already ended and pushes their room IDs back into the `availableRoomIds` heap.
        count[roomId] += 1 #If there are available rooms (`availableRoomIds` is not empty), it allocates one of these rooms to the current meeting. It updates the count of meetings for the allocated room and adds the meeting to the `occupied` list.
        heapq.heappush(occupied, (end, roomId)) 
      else:
        newStart, roomId = heapq.heappop(occupied)
        count[roomId] += 1
        heapq.heappush(occupied, (newStart + (end - start), roomId))
        #If no room is available, it pops the meeting with the earliest end time from `occupied`, extends its end time to accommodate the current meeting, updates the count for the room, and pushes it back into `occupied`.

    return count.index(max(count)) #Finally, it returns the index of the room with the maximum count of booked meetings.

#Time Complexity : O(sort(meetings))
#Space Complexity : O(n)

#The above approach efficiently assigns rooms to meetings while considering the availability of rooms and minimizing room changes. The use of heaps helps in quickly finding available rooms and meetings with the earliest end times. Overall, the code provides a solution to find the most booked room in a meeting scheduling scenario.
