#The below Python function aims to find the minimum possible maximum pair sum of a list of integers.
class Solution:
    #Sorting the Input List: The function begins by sorting the input list of integers (`nums`). Sorting the list allows us to pair the smallest number with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This step ensures that the pairs are formed in such a way that the pair sums are balanced.

  def minPairSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    nums.sort()
    return max(nums[i] + nums[len(nums) - 1 - i] for i in range(len(nums) // 2))

    #Iterating Over Pairs: Next, the function iterates over the indices of the first half of the sorted list. It only needs to iterate up to the midpoint of the list (`len(nums) // 2`). For each index `i`, it calculates the sum of the number at index `i` and the number at the corresponding position from the end of the list (`len(nums) - 1 - i`).

    #Finding the Maximum Pair Sum: During each iteration, it computes the sum of the current pair and finds the maximum of all such sums. This maximum represents the minimum possible maximum pair sum achievable by pairing the numbers in the input list.

    #Returning the Result: Finally, the function returns the maximum of all pair sums calculated in the loop, which represents the minimum possible maximum pair sum for the given input list.

    #In summary, this function efficiently determines the minimum possible maximum pair sum by sorting the input list and pairing its elements in such a way that the pair sums are optimized to minimize the maximum sum.
