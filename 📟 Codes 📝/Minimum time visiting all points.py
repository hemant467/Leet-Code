#The below code calculates the minimum time required to visit all points in a given list of points. 

#It assumes that the time taken to move from one point to another is the maximum of the absolute differences in their x-coordinates and y-coordinates.

class Solution:
  def minTimeToVisitAllPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    #Initialization:
    ans = 0 #Initialize `ans` to 0. This variable will store the total time taken to visit all points.

    #Iterate Through Points:
    for i in range(1, len(points)): #Use a for loop to iterate through each pair of adjacent points in the list `points`.
    #For each pair of points (current point and the previous point), calculate the time taken to move from the previous point to the current point.

      ans += max(abs(points[i][0] - points[i - 1][0]),
                 abs(points[i][1] - points[i - 1][1])) #The time taken is the maximum of the absolute differences between the x-coordinates (`points[i][0] - points[i - 1][0]`) and y-coordinates (`points[i][1] - points[i - 1][1]`).

    #Return Answer:
    return ans #After iterating through all pairs of points, the variable `ans` contains the total time taken to visit all points.
