#The below code is a method to count the total number of characters that can be formed using the letters in the `chars` string, considering each word in the `words` list.
class Solution:
    #Initialization:
  def countCharacters(self, words: List[str], chars: str) -> int:
    #Initialize two variables:
    ans = 0 #`ans`: Represents the count of characters that can be formed using letters from `chars`.
    count = collections.Counter(chars) #`count`: A Counter object that stores the frequency of each character in the `chars` string.

    #Iterate Through Words:
    for word in words: #for loop to iterate through each word in the `words` list.
      tempCount = count.copy() #For each word, create a copy of the `count` dictionary to ensure that modifications don't affect the original `count`.
      for c in word: #Iterate through each character `c` in the current word.
        tempCount[c] -= 1 #Decrement the count of character `c` in the `tempCount` dictionary.
        if tempCount[c] < 0: #If the count of character `c` becomes negative in `tempCount`, it means there aren't enough characters in `chars` to form the word.
          ans -= len(word) #so decrement `ans` by the length of the current word.
          break #and break out of the inner loop.

    #Update Answer:
      ans += len(word) #After the inner loop, increment `ans` by the length of the current word, as all characters in the word can be formed using the letters in `chars`.

    #Return Answer: After processing all words, the final value of `ans` represents the total count of characters that can be formed using the letters in `chars`.
    return ans

#Time Complexity : O(n)
#Space Complexity : O(n)

#The above approach efficiently counts the characters that can be formed using the available letters in `chars`, considering each word in the `words` list. If any word requires characters that are not available in `chars`, it reduces the count accordingly. Finally, it returns the total count of characters that can be formed.
