//The provided code is an implementation of finding the kth character in the kth row of a special binary grammar sequence. This sequence starts with 0 and is constructed in the following way:

//If the current character is 0, the next row will be "01".
//If the current character is 1, the next row will be "10".

class Solution 
{
  public int kthGrammar(int n, int k) 
  {
    //Base case for the first row:
    if (n == 1) //If we are at the first row (n == 1), return 0, as it is the only character in the first row.
      return 0;
    
    //Determine if the current node is on the left or right:
    if (k % 2 == 1) //If k is odd, we are at the left node in the current row.
      return kthGrammar(n - 1, (k + 1) / 2) == 0 ? 0 : 1; // the left node. Recursively call the function for the left child (n - 1, (k + 1) / 2) and check if it returns 0. If it does, return 0; otherwise, return 1.
    return kthGrammar(n - 1, k / 2) == 0 ? 1 : 0;         // the right node. Recursively call the function for the right child (n - 1, k / 2) and check if it returns 0. If it does, return 1; otherwise, return 0.
  }
    //To navigate through the tree-like structure of the sequence based on whether the current node is on the left or right. 
    //The 'recursion' is used to traverse through the rows until reaching the base case for the first row. 
    //The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the row number.
