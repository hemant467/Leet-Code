#Python function `numberOfWays` that calculates the number of ways to sit on seats in a corridor without violating the social distancing rules.

class Solution:
    #Initialization:
  def numberOfWays(self, corridor: str) -> int:
    kMod = 1_000_000_007 #Initialize `kMod` to 1_000_000_007, which is used to perform modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.
    ans = 1 #Initialize `ans` to 1, which will store the final result.
    prevSeat = -1 #Initialize `prevSeat` to -1, which keeps track of the position of the previously encountered seat.
    numSeats = 0 #Initialize `numSeats` to 0, which counts the number of seats encountered so far.

    #Iterating through the Corridor:
    for i, c in enumerate(corridor): #Iterate through each character `c` and its index `i` in the `corridor` string.
      if c == 'S': #If the character `c` is 'S' (indicating a seat):
        numSeats += 1 #Increment `numSeats` by 1.
        if numSeats > 2 and numSeats & 1: #Check if the number of seats encountered so far (`numSeats`) is greater than 2 and odd. If so, it indicates that there are at least two consecutive seats with one empty seat between them. In this case:
          ans = ans * (i - prevSeat) % kMod #Update `ans` by multiplying it by the distance between the current seat `i` and the previous seat `prevSeat`, and then take the result modulo `kMod`.
        
        prevSeat = i #Update `prevSeat` to the current seat `i`.

    #Return the Result:
    return ans if numSeats > 1 and numSeats % 2 == 0 else 0 #After iterating through all characters in the `corridor`, check if there are at least two seats (`numSeats > 1`) and the total number of seats is even (`numSeats % 2 == 0`). If both conditions are met, return the final value of `ans`; otherwise, return 0.

    #The above approach calculates the number of ways to sit on seats in the corridor while maintaining social distancing by considering the distances between consecutive seats. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the `corridor` string.
