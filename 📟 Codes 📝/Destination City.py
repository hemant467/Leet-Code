#The below Python function `destCity` takes a list of lists `paths` as input, where each inner list contains two strings representing a directed edge from city `a` to city `b`. The function returns the destination city, i.e., the city that is not the starting city in any of the paths.
class Solution:
  def destCity(self, paths: List[List[str]]) -> str:
    count = collections.Counter() #It initializes a counter `count` using `collections.Counter()`. This counter will be used to keep track of the count of outgoing edges from each city.

    for a, b in paths: #It iterates through each pair `(a, b)` in the `paths` list.
      count[a] += 1 #For each pair, it increments the count of outgoing edges from city `a` by 1 using `count[a] += 1`.

    for a, b in paths: #After counting the outgoing edges from each city, it iterates through each pair `(a, b)` in the `paths` list again.
      
      if b in count: #For each pair, it checks if the destination city `b` is present in the `count` counter:
        count[b] -= 1 #If `b` is present in `count`, it decrements the count of outgoing edges from city `b` by 1 using `count[b] -= 1`.
        if count[b] == 0: #If the count of outgoing edges from city `b` becomes 0 after decrementing, it means that `b` is not the starting city of any path. In this case, it removes `b` from the `count` counter using `del count[b]`.
          del count[b] #If `b` is not present in `count`, it means that `b` is not the starting city of any path, so it returns `b`.

          #If no destination city is found in the above step, it means that the destination city is the starting city of a path but not the ending city. In this case, the loop will not return any city, and the function will terminate, implying that there is no destination city.
      else:
        return b #Finally, the function returns the destination city found in step 3.

    #The above code efficiently finds the destination city by keeping track of outgoing edges from each city and checking if a city has no outgoing edges, indicating that it is the destination city. The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of paths in the input list `paths`. This is because the code iterates through the `paths` list twice, and the counter operations take O(1) time.
