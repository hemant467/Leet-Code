#The below code is a method to check if two lists of strings, `word1` and `word2`, represent the same string when concatenated.
class Solution:
    #Initialization:
  def arrayStringsAreEqual(self, word1: List[str], word2: List[str]) -> bool:
    #Initialize four variables:
    i = 0  # Index to iterate through word1's index
    j = 0  # Index to iterate through word2's index
    a = 0  # Index to iterate through the current string in word1[i]'s index
    b = 0  # Index to iterate through the current string in word2[j]'s index

    #Iterative Comparison:
    while i < len(word1) and j < len(word2): #Using a while loop to iterate through `word1` and `word2` simultaneously
      if word1[i][a] != word2[j][b]: #Compare characters at the current indices `a` and `b` of the strings in `word1[i]` and `word2[j]`, respectively.
        return False #If the characters are not equal, return `False`.

    #Increment indices `a` and `b`.
      a += 1
      if a == len(word1[i]): #If `a` reaches the end of the current string in `word1[i]`.
        i += 1 #increment `i`
        a = 0 #reset `a` to 0.
      b += 1
      if b == len(word2[j]): #If `b` reaches the end of the current string in `word2[j]`
        j += 1 #increment `j`
        b = 0 #reset `b` to 0.

    #Check if Both Lists Are Fully Iterated: After the loop, check if both `i` and `j` have reached the end of their respective lists. If not, return `False`.

    #Return Result:
    return i == len(word1) and j == len(word2) #If both lists are fully iterated, return `True`, indicating that the two lists represent the same concatenated string.
