#The below Python function `numSpecial` counts the number of "special" cells in a binary matrix. A cell is considered "special" if it contains a 1 and it is the only 1 in its row and column.
class Solution:
  def numSpecial(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    #Initialize variables `m` and `n` to store the number of rows and columns in the matrix `mat`.
    m = len(mat) #To store number of rows in the matrix 'mat'.
    n = len(mat[0]) #To store number of columns in the matrix 'mat'.
    ans = 0 #It initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will store the count of special cells.

    rowOnes = [0] * m
    colOnes = [0] * n
    #It initializes two lists `rowOnes` and `colOnes` of length `m` and `n` respectively, to store the count of ones in each row and each column.

    for i in range(m):
      for j in range(n):
        #It iterates through each cell `(i, j)` in the matrix `mat`.
        if mat[i][j] == 1: #For each cell, if the value is 1, it increments the corresponding counters in `rowOnes` and `colOnes`.
          rowOnes[i] += 1 #Incrementing counters in 'rowOnes'.
          colOnes[j] += 1 #Incrementing counters in 'colOnes'.

#After counting the number of ones in each row and each column, it iterates through each cell again.

    for i in range(m):
      for j in range(n):
        if mat[i][j] == 1 and rowOnes[i] == 1 and colOnes[j] == 1:
          ans += 1
          #For each cell `(i, j)`, if the value is 1 and both `rowOnes[i]` and `colOnes[j]` are equal to 1, it increments the `ans` variable.

    #Return answer:
    return ans #Finally, it returns the value of `ans`, which represents the count of special cells in the matrix.
