//The below Java code checks if it's possible to reach a destination point `(fx, fy)` from a starting point `(sx, sy)` within a given time `t`, assuming that the movement from one point to another takes one unit of time and can only be made in vertical or horizontal directions (no diagonal movement).
class Solution 
{
  public boolean isReachableAtTime(int sx, int sy, int fx, int fy, int t)
    //Calculate Minimum Steps : Calculate the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination `(fx, fy)` from the starting point `(sx, sy)`. This is done by taking the maximum absolute difference between the x-coordinates (`sx` and `fx`) and the y-coordinates (`sy` and `fy`) of the two points. This ensures that the movement is always made towards the destination either horizontally or vertically, taking the longer distance as the number of steps.

  {
    //Check Reachability : If `minStep` (the minimum number of steps required) is equal to 0, it means that the starting and destination points are the same. In this case, the destination can only be reached if the time `t` is greater than 1, because it takes at least one unit of time to make the move. So, if `minStep` is 0, the function returns `t != 1`.

   //If `minStep` is not equal to 0, it means that there are steps required to reach the destination. In this case, the function returns `minStep <= t`, indicating that the destination can be reached within the given time `t` if the number of steps required is less than or equal to `t`.


    final int minStep = Math.max(Math.abs(sx - fx), Math.abs(sy - fy));

    //Return : The function returns `true` if the destination can be reached within the given time `t`, and `false` otherwise.
    return minStep == 0 ? t != 1 : minStep <= t;
  }
  //The above code calculates the minimum steps required to reach the destination and checks if this number of steps is less than or equal to the given time `t`. If so, it returns `true`, indicating that the destination can be reached within the given time; otherwise, it returns `false`. If the starting and destination points are the same, it checks if `t` is greater than 1, as it's only possible to reach the destination if time `t` is greater than 1 in this case.
